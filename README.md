# Project_Submission
The Task2 and Task3 presentations are uploadedin both .odp and .pptx format but it would be better if they are viewed in Google Slides by opening it through the links provided in the 
GoogleSlideLinksForTask2and3 text file as if viewed on Google slides the attached videos will direclty play in the presentation itself.

I am also giving the same links which are in GoogleSlideLinksForTask2and3 text file below:
